# Beaglebone_NodeJS
This project uses a Beaglebone black, ARM mbed, and a custom built radar system. The user can connect to Beaglebone via WiFi and will be served a webpage hosted by BBB using Node.js. Using the web interface one can make the radar scan at a particular angle, start/stop scanning, get all the obstacle coordinates etc.
